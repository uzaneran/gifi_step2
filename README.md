# gifi_step2

 you can add all the files to one directory for a seperated files type (html,css,js) 
 or just open the master_index.php (includes css/js)

Step_2 was really hard for me to do, for some reasons

a. The API is kind of new for me.
b. I never used GIT before.
c. I had to look deep in the js/jquery documentations to find methods and explore them, to refresh my memory
   for example, 
   in PHP i know how to run 'foreach' loop and create the Html markups, and i had to find the way to do so in js.

I was sitting on it looking for the solution yesterday 'till 3:00AM, 
I got some solution with php mainly..

But today i decided to start all over again,
I was searching for codes in the Internet - including your code, watched them, learned them,
And eventually got my own.
It was really important for me to succeed, 
I am willing to learn all the time.

Thank you,
Eran.
